# Wrap Google Meet into a native macOS application

Requires [nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier).

Recommended to be used in combination with [Finicky](https://github.com/johnste/finicky) or [Choosy](https://www.choosyosx.com/). May require a second link click in case the app wasn't running before, see [nativefier issue #1516](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/issues/1516).

Would love to add a stay/float on top functionality, waiting for [nativefier issue #1515](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/issues/1515).
